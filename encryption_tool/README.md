# 🔐 Encrypt System

This is a simple **encryption system built in Python**.

It uses:

- `Fernet` (from `cryptography`)
- `os`
- `path`
- `platform`
- `pathlib`
- `smtplib`
- `email.mime`

The script demonstrates how data can be encrypted and how an encryption key can be sent to a user’s email.  
It is inspired by techniques used in cybersecurity for analysis and awareness.

This project is especially useful for:

- Cybersecurity students  
- Beginners learning how Python interacts with the system  
- Understanding how ransomware-like mechanisms are built  

By studying this, learners can see:

- How Python accesses files and directories  
- How encryption works in practice  
- How attackers may lock data and demand a key  
- Why system security is critical  

>**Disclaimer**  
> This project is made **strictly for educational purposes**.  
> It is intended to help students understand how such systems work so they can learn how to defend against them—not to harm any system or data.
